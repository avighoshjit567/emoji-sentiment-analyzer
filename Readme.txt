# Emoji Sentiment Analyzer

## Description

The Emoji Sentiment Analyzer is a Laravel-based web application that performs sentiment analysis on text 
by extracting emojis and calculating sentiment scores based on predefined values. The application allows users to submit text containing emojis, analyze the sentiment, and view the results. It supports asynchronous processing using Laravel Queues and provides an API endpoint secured with token-based authentication.

        http://localhost:8000/api/analyze \
        -d '{"text": "I am happy ðŸ˜Š"}'
